# Open Icons Library
## Why does this exist?
### tl;dr
I always encounter a situation where I have a missing icon during from an icons pack or some icons in a pack are offered for an amount of money. So I decided to make a library of icons that everybody (well, those who respect guidelines and submit decent designs) can add to.
